# RunSmart

RunSmart is a web-first training planning app concept for endurance runners. It focuses on practical
periodization, explainable AI coaching insights, and privacy-first data handling.

## Project status

This repository currently contains a static front-end prototype based on the product vision described
in `agents.md`. The UI is ready for iterative additions like Firebase-backed auth, Strava ingestion,
and the AI training agents.

## Local development

Open `index.html` directly in the browser or run a simple static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
